This is a prototype of a vanilla-kernel-based livecd rework. The idea is that
instead of aufs (which has design problems, and probably won't be integrated to
the vanilla kernel ever), we can use dmsetup to do the "cd is read-only, but
make it writeble in the memory" trick.

In fact dracut has full support for this, so a few lines of shell-script can do
all the Frugalware-specific part.

WARNING: Any file or directory in this subdirectory may be overwritten or deleted
during creating the livecd, except the .sh files!

To try it yourself, run each script after each other, the last one will boot up
the result in qemu.
