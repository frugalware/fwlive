This is the source of the Frugalware LiveCD, FWLive.

Building
--------

To build the livecd:

	$ sudo make

To clean up compiled code in the source dir:

	$ sudo make clean

To remove the building chroot:

	$ sudo make distclean

From scratch
------------

If you never compiled the FWLive, you need the following steps:

cd ~
mkdir -p git
cd git
git clone http://git.frugalware.org/repos/fwlive/.git
git clone http://git.frugalware.org/repos/translations/.git
cd fwlive

Check if all referenced repos are configured. Check the TREE variable in the
file 'config': for example if it contains 'current' then check if current is
enabled as a repo in /etc/repoman.conf.

then read the section titled "Building".

NOTE: you can place your fwlive repo anywhere you want, and if you want to
place your translations repo somewhere else, you just need to edit po/Makefile.

Customizing
-----------

Have a look at the file named 'config', you can set several configuration
options there.
