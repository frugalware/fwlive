This is the source of the Frugalware LiveCD, FWLive.

Building
--------

To build the livecd:

	# make

To clean up compiled code in the source dir:

	# make clean

To remove the building chroot:

	# make distclean

From scratch
------------

If you never compiled the FWLive, you need the following steps:

cd ~
mkdir darcs
cd darcs
darcs get --partial http://darcs.frugalware.org/repos/fwlive
darcs get --partial http://darcs.frugalware.org/repos/translations
su -
ln -s ~user/darcs ./
cd darcs/fwlive

then read the section titled "Building".

NOTE: you can place your fwlive repo where you want, and if you want to place
your translations repo somewhere else, you just need to edit po/Makefile.

Customizing
-----------

Have a look at the file named 'config', you can set several configuration
options there.
