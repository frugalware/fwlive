This is the source of the Frugalware LiveCD, FWLive.

Building
--------

To build the livecd suitable for development:

	$ sudo make

or one suitable for release:

	$ sudo make CONFIG=release

To clean up:

	$ sudo make clean

From scratch
------------

If you never compiled the FWLive, you need the following steps:

cd ~
mkdir -p git
cd git
git clone http://frugalware.org/git/pub/other/fwlive
cd fwlive

Check if all referenced repos are configured. Check the TREE variable in the
file 'config': for example if it contains 'current' then check if current is
enabled as a repo in /etc/repoman.conf.

then read the section titled "Building".

NOTE: you can place your fwlive repo anywhere you want.

Customizing
-----------

Have a look at the file named 'config', you can set several configuration
options there.
