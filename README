This is the source of the Frugalware LiveCD, FWLive.


Building
--------

To build the livecd suitable for development:

	$ sudo make

or one suitable for testing:

	$ sudo make CONFIG=testing

or one suitable for release:

	$ sudo make CONFIG=release

To clean up:

	$ sudo make clean

From scratch
------------

If you never compiled the FWLive, you need the following steps:

cd ~
mkdir -p git
cd git
git clone http://frugalware.org/git/pub/other/fwlive
cd fwlive

Check if all referenced repos are configured. Check the TREE variable in the
file 'config': for example if it contains 'current' then check if current is
enabled as a repo in /etc/repoman.conf.

then read the section titled "Building".

NOTE: you can place your fwlive repo anywhere you want.

Customizing
-----------

Have a look at the file named 'config', you can set several configuration
options there.
=======
				Fwife : Frugalware Installer Frontend Readme

-> Fwife 0.9.5

-> Compiling and testing :

You have to create the configure file. Run './autogen.sh'.
Next run './configure OPTIONS'. Use './configure --help' for more details about OPTIONS.

For debugging you can use following options:
--enable-debug : Compile without NDEBUG preprocessor define
--enable-werror : compile with -Werror flag
--enable-strict : add a lot of flags and a lot of warnings ;)

Run 'make' and 'make install'. Now you can test fwife, just run fwife as root :)
To clean the directory, use 'autoclean.sh'

-> The End

Any suggestions or patchs are welcome ;)
