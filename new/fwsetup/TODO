before 1.9:

add selection for default systemd boot target
test 4096 byte sector disk drive handling code in block.c
implement greeting UI

disable tty blanking
check that partitions are aligned mebibyte boundaries
check if gpt has bios boot partition
implement network setup

look into what can be done about sfdisk failing due to busy devices

future improvements:

replace my method of retrieving disk unique identifier with libblkid's API, should be in v2.23.
if libfdisk can replace our writing needs, then use that instead of running fdisk/gdisk.
see if unicode handling of GPT partition names can be fixed
add detailed error handling for when a pacman transaction fails
